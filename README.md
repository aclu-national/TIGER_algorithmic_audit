# TIGER Algorithmic Audit

## Purpose
The purpose of this research is to audit the Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry (TIGER) system to ensure that the risk and needs models apply equitably.

## Analysis
We believe that the TIGER suite of algorithms are used to categorize all people in prisons in Louisiana. The suite currently contains 5 risk models, meant to predict the likelyhood of recidivating and 2 needs models, meant to predict programing that one may need. The models include: 

1. Mature Risk Model,
2. Supervision Risk Model,
3. Dynamic Risk Model,
4. Institutional Risk Model,
5. TIGER 5 Needs Model,
6. TIGER 5 Mini Needs Model.
